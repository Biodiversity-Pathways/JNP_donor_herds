This repository contains the code for analyses [Biodiversity
Pathways](https://biodiversitypathways.ca) did on behalf of Jasper
National Park (JNP) to identify potential source herds of Southern
Mountain Caribou to start their captive breeding program. The final
report can be found [here]().

Below are tables from the report that can be sorted interactively to aid
decision-making.

### Pre-removal status

Predicted 2024 herd statuses for herds based on the IPM and last known
field censuses

### Summary of years to recovery under each scenario

Predicted years to recovery combined across scenarios. Subpopulations
are ranked by predicted cow growth in the 2024-2025 without removals,
highlighting number of “surplus” cows.
